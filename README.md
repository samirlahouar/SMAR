# SMAR
Système de Modélisation et d'Animation des Robots

This version of SMAR, originally developed at the University of Poitiers and which I enhanced during my [PhD]([URL](https://www.theses.fr/2008POIT2252))
 to simulate complex parallel robots with closed kinematic loops, has been completely restructured and written in JAVA for compatibility with Android phones and tablets. It bears no resemblance to the previous C++ iteration.
